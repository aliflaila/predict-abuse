# predict-abuse

Following the #MeToo movement we had a lot of people opening up about their sexual harassment incidents, but as with any internet viral movement, it faded with time. However, this plethora of information can be used effectively to automatically classify abuse incidents into appropriate categories.

The project aims to leverage this information and predict the type of abuse by the description available using Natural Language processing.
